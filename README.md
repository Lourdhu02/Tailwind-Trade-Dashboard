# ðŸ“Š Power BI Tailwind Sales Analysis Dashboard

This project focuses on analyzing Tailwindâ€™s sales data using Power BI. It involves end-to-end data modeling, ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes, data optimization, and comprehensive visualizations to gain insights into sales performance.

## ðŸš€ Features

1. **Data Modeling**:
   - Structured and optimized sales data for easier analysis.
   - Creation of relationships between multiple tables such as sales, products, customers, and regions.

2. **ETL Process**:
   - Extracted raw data, transformed it by cleaning and enhancing key metrics, and loaded it into Power BI.
   - Ensured data quality by handling missing values, duplicates, and formatting inconsistencies.

3. **Sales Performance Analysis**:
   - Overview of sales trends, revenue, and key metrics such as sales by product category, region, and time period.
   - Analysis of customer behavior and regional performance to identify trends and patterns.

4. **Data Optimization**:
   - Optimized data models to improve performance and query speed within Power BI.
   - Implemented calculated columns and measures to streamline reporting.

5. **Interactive Visualizations**:
   - Dynamic charts and graphs showing sales performance over time.
   - Visuals to compare sales across different regions and product categories.
   - A dashboard that allows users to drill down into specific data points and apply filters for deeper insights.

## ðŸ“ˆ Visualizations

- **Sales Overview Dashboard**: A high-level summary of key sales metrics like total sales, number of transactions, and top-performing products.
- **Revenue Trend Analysis**: A line graph showing sales performance over time, allowing users to track growth or decline.
- **Regional Sales Comparison**: A map and bar charts comparing sales across different regions and customer segments.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

The dataset includes the following tables:

- **Sales**: Transaction details such as date, product, quantity, and revenue.
- **Products**: Product categories and descriptions.
- **Customers**: Information on customer demographics and location.
- **Regions**: Geographical data to analyze sales performance by region.
